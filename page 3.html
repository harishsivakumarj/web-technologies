            <ul>
                <li>A website is a collection of publicly accessible, interlinked Web pages that share a single domain name.</li>
                <li>Websites can be created and maintained by an individual, group, business or organization to serve a variety of purposes.</li>
                <li>Together, all publicly accessible websites constitute the World Wide Web.</li>
                <li>Although it is sometimes called <b> “web page,”</b> this definition is wrong, since a website consists of several webpages.
                    <br> A website is also known as a <b>“web presence”</b> or simply <b>“site”</b>.</li>

                Web development, also known as website development, refers to the tasks associated with creating, building, and maintaining websites and web applications that run online on a browser. <br> It may, however, also include web design, web programming, and database management.
            </p>
            <p>There are three main types of web development: <b>front-end, back-end</b> and <b>full-stack.</b></p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Front-end development </b>focuses on the visual aspects of a website the part that users see and interact with.</li>
                <li><b>Back-end development</b> comprises a site's structure, system, data, and logic.</li>
            </ol>
